# README #

This library is a python interface to the RGB LED strips such as [BlinkyTape](http://blinkinlabs.com/blinkytape/).
It provides support for rendering full frames on demand to the tape.

This repository includes:

* blinkyLib - Python classes that provide the interface and basic classes to create frames
* test.py - Sample application demonstrating the features of the Blinky library.

### BlinkyTape Notes ###

The communication methods and details in this library are based on the PatternPaint sketch and color swirl:

* https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/PatternPaint/blob/master/src/PatternPaint/PatternPlayer_Sketch/PatternPlayer_Sketch.ino
* https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/PatternPaint/blob/master/src/PatternPaint/ColorSwirl_Sketch.h
* https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/BlinkyTape_Arduino/blob/master/examples/ColorSwirl/ColorSwirl.ino

You need to install driver first and the easiest method is to install [PatternPaint](http://blinkinlabs.com/software/patternpaint/).
The driver can also be [installed manually](http://forums.blinkinlabs.com/index.php?p=/discussion/92/windows-standalone-driver-installer) if required.
